WHO Global Health Data Analysis 🌍
Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global health indicators published by the World Health Organization (WHO). The analysis aims to understand health patterns, identify disparities across countries and regions, and highlight data quality challenges that commonly appear in real-world datasets.

The project is designed as a portfolio-ready data analysis case study, demonstrating structured thinking, data cleaning skills, and the ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights.

Objectives

Analyze global health indicators across 190+ countries

Assess data quality and handle missing values systematically

Explore distributions and variations in key health metrics

Compare health outcomes across regions

Extract insights relevant to public health decision-making

Dataset Information

Source: World Health Organization (WHO)

Scope: Global health indicators

Coverage: Multiple countries and regions

Use Case: Educational and analytical purposes only

The dataset includes indicators related to life expectancy, mortality, and other public health measures, offering a broad view of global health outcomes.

Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Project Workflow

Data Understanding

Examined dataset structure using .info() and .describe()

Identified data types, null values, and inconsistencies

Data Cleaning

Handled missing values present in several indicators

Ensured consistency in formats for reliable analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions of key health metrics

Visualized regional and country-level variations

Insights & Interpretation

Identified major disparities in global health outcomes

Highlighted indicators with significant cross-country variation

Key Insights

Significant health disparities exist between regions, with life expectancy differing by 20+ years between some countries

Several indicators contained 20–30% missing values, emphasizing the importance of data preprocessing

Mortality-related metrics showed strong regional concentration, indicating unequal access to healthcare resources
